# unit-4-game
Fun and interactive game for web browsers: App dynamically updates HTML pages with the jQuery library.

Game Summary:

At the beginning of the game a random number between 19 and 120 is generated. Your goal is to get your score equal to this random number, but not to surpass it. If you surpass the random number, you lose. 

How to play:
Your score will start at 0. 

There are 4 crystals on the page, and each crystal represents a hidden number. 
Click on the crystal to see it's value. It's value will be reflected in the "Total Score" section. 
Each crystal has a value between 1 and 12. 
Everytime you click on a crystal, it's value will be added to your total score. 

If your total score equals the random number, you win!
If your total score goes higher than the random number, you lose. 

If you win or lose, the game will reset with a new random number and every crystal will have a new secret value.

Good luck!
